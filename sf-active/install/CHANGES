SF-ACTIVE v0.9.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------

o The documentation has been updated a lot. It still isn't complete. (most
complete versions are english and dutch).

o The date_entered column has been dropped from the webcast table (it wasn't 
used anyway).

o email validation is now stored in its own table instead of webcast
(much less wasteful of our already bloated webcast table)
 - for upgrades, see the patches in install/

o it's now possible to mirror uploaded files to a mirror server(s) directly
while uploading. (before you needed pytoeye.py)

o fixed bug in validating of uploads. it allowed only 19 files while the form
allowed 20

o the date is now the same in the comment_box in article.php as in the long 
comment in article_comment.php. It still doesn't honour dst (daylight saving
time).

o you can now also upload rtf files. also the list on the publish pages of
which files you can upload is now defined in shared/global.cfg (so users get
an up to date list even if translations aren't up to date).

o fixed a bug that prevented the search to display thumbnails of pictures 
published in attachments and comments

o the calendar now uses the same system as the articles to handle html & 
plain text input. (this fixes a presentation bug with html events). (requires
dbase patch patch_094_calendar_artmime.sql)

o fixed a bug that prevented the main newswire from being refreshed when you edit
the status of an article

o The mysql_db_sample_data are updated so the default category comes with a
newswire and a center column.

o If you add, edit or update location, you will now be redirected to the right
page (instead of getting an error/warning about headers

o Articles, events and features are now associated with a certain language,
that will display in feeds and is searchable

o You can now define and control the languages your site supports in the 
admin.

o We now keep track of when administrators last logged in (this requires 
dbase patch patch_094_last_login.sql). you can also order the list of your
users on most columns of the user table.

o The calendar search will now display thumbnails of published images

o You can now publish a file (like with articles) in the calendar
(this requires dbase patch patch_094_calendar.sql).

o Support for a static minicalendar (= upcoming events on frontpage).

o use dcterms:hasPart to syndicate linked files (features, newswire and 
calendar) 

o license changed to GPL. added copy of GPL in install

o There is configurable support for email validation of posted articles

select-forms have been replaced by cached array's. Some more unneeded 
queries have been removed.

content:encoded (= full html of the article). (encoding issues is for next

categories when publishing.

o Uploads are now stored in monthly subdirectories inside SF_UPLOAD_PATH.

is too simple you're jailed on the page to change until it's found safe.

sometimes executed before the authentication handling.

translated into french.

been brought up to date. Basic croatian translation available.

o The database layer has been fixed. The database connection isn't
closed anymore after each query.

o You can now set site-specific limits on the amount of articles
people can publish in a certain time. You can have different variables 
for the amount of articles & for articles with the same content.

o the calendar doesn't allow any longer to browse into eternity into 
the past/feature (bug #95)

o you can now turn off the limiting of search results

o there is now a cli-script that allows you to refresh all the 
ramfiles in case your realserver setup changes. (bug #141)

o the upload section in the admin is fixed so it uses the settings
in the sfactive.cfg file

o mailinglist.php has been updated so it works better with mailman.

SF-ACTIVE v0.9
--------------------------------------------------------------------

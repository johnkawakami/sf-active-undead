To Set Up Your Calendar:

- All tables & sample data you need are now in the mysql_db.sql & mysql_db_sample_data.sql.
So if you install sfactive it should work by default.

- Locations, topics and types can now be directly managed from the admin.

- If you use an old version of sf-active, you probably need to patch your database. take
a look at patch_calendar_for_install.sql.

0.9.2 -> 0.9.4 DATABASE PATCH NOTES
-----------------------------------
Patching your db for 0.9.4 depends on whether or not you've already
applied the install/patch_email_validation.sql from 0.9.2

If you aren't sure, do 'desc webcast' and look for a validation
column. 

If there is a validation column or you know you've applied the 
install/patch_email_validation.sql patch, first you must apply
install/patch_094_092_validation_removed_from_webcast.sql

Then, apply the following patches for 0.9.4:
install/patch_094_new_validation_table.sql
install/patch_094_calendar.sql
install/patch_094_calendar_artmime.sql
install/patch_094_language_event.sql
install/patch_094_language_feature.sql
install/patch_094_language_table.sql
install/patch_094_language_webcast.sql
install/patch_094_last_login.sql
